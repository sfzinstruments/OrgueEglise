Converted from the original GigaSampler version by S. Christian Collins

## Changelog

* 1.1
   - The samples are mono, but I wanted to create a better sense of space, so I implemented stereo keytrack panning with low notes on the left and high notes on the right of the stereo field. The amount of keytrack panning can be controlled using CC#21 and is set to 50% (64) by default.
* 1.0
   - Initial conversion from the original GigaSampler version.
